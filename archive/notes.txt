TODO: Buying servers is stonks

I think I'm seeing how I gotta do things.
Basically run a farming process and a prepping process simultaneously.
There would be two ports involved here.
One port is how the prepping process reserves a certain number of threads for its use.
The other port is used by a few different processes (such as the server buying process?)
to let the farming process know when there's additional threads available
actually they could be one port

New farm port looks like this:
{
	"noodles": {
		"cycle": 1,
		"buffer": 200,
		"cycleTime": 1857821,
		"minCycleTime": 1800000,
		"numberOfBatches": 1152,
		"batches": [
			{"weakenTime": 243928,
			"growTime": 498732,
			"hackTime": 472398},
			{"weakenTime": 243928,
			"growTime": 498732,
			"hackTime": 472398},
			{"weakenTime": 243928,
			"growTime": 498732,
			"hackTime": 472398},
		]
	}
}
